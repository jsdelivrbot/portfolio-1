      <h3>Design Bio</h3>
      <p>As a designer, I've worked with METRO Group, Techstars, JetBlue, Silicon Valley Bank, Rally Software, and a spread of venture-backed startups across the US, UK, and Germany.</p>
      <p>After going through Techstars Boulder in 2014, I led Mocktail, a design agency in the music industry in Berlin, Germany until fall of 2016.</p>
      <p>In fall of 2016 I worked with Fresh Tilled Soil in Boston as a UX strategy apprentice, and have since been building VR products and freelancing.</p>
      <p>This portfolio highlights how I think about product through three key projects across mediums and industries. Although a disproportionate amount of my design career has been spent producing wireframes and interface flows, this portfolio takes a higher-level approach and collects artifacts from all steps of the product process, as well as some lessons learned.</p>
