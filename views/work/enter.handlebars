    <h2>Enter App</h2>
    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Good onboarding experiences expertly guide people through the anxiety and confusion of a new product until they reach value. The time-to-value needs to be as short as possible and control for distractions and key anxieties that would otherwise turn a user away.</p>
    <p>In Enter's case, there is a large amount of data that needs to be entered to get the product up-and-running, initially by the office manager, and then on an asynchronous basis by everyone else in the office.</p>
    <p>Additionally, because the app runs on an iPad, the onboarding is potentially split between multiple devices, which adds another level of confusion and two potential tripping points to the flow.</p>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>By using the office manager's information collected during the free trial setup as the first user profile, the product can become functional very early on in the new onboarding flow. The user could potentially reach value within 2-3 minutes of clicking the free-trial signup button. The rest of the information can then be added later during other sessions to maximize value to the user and help them welcome guests.</p>

    <h3>On Microcopy</h3>
    <p>Walking through all the microcopy with someone who has no concept of the product or use cases helped refine and flag problems that the team didn't see. Likely these problems like the ambiguous "group add" vs. the clearer and directive "paste a bunch" would have been picked up in extensive user testing, but that's not always in the budget.</p><p> Five minutes could save you 15% or more on customer onboarding retention rates.</p>
