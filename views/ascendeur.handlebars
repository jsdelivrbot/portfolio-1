    Ascendeur had brought me to a company retreat in advance of the brand project, so I was very familiar with the mission and values. We had previously generated a lot of word clouds and mission statements, so I combined those with a few brainstorming sessions, then got busy sketching from the huge pile of ideas already on paper. I sat in the corner of a cafe in Budapest on the river for a week and produced around 200 sketches, then drafted those up in Illustrator and sent three over.

    Those drafts then evolved into the final logo over the course of three months. It was a long project. Somewhere in there I got pneumonia. That wasnâ€™t fun. Near the end, I worked through colors, layout, typography, email signatures, and all the weird little deliverable .pdfs that go with comprehensive brand projects.
