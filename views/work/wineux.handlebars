    <h4>Redesigning a legacy industry</h4>
    <h2>The UX of Wine</h2>
    <h3>üç∑</h3>

    <h3 class="mt3">Summary</h3>
    <h4></h4>
    <p>Wine retailers and producers don‚Äôt give consumers the information and tools they need to make purchase decisions.</p>
    <h6>Hypotheses</h6>
    <p>By understanding how and why people buy wine, you can design better experiences for consumers with an end result of selling more wine to more people.</p>
    <p>I built three prototypes, each testing different hypotheses. The first was a POP and paper interaction, the second was built in InVision and Sketch, and the third was built in Unity3D for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive headsets.</p>

    <h3>Initial Research</h3>
    <p>In order to understand the wine ecosystem, I talked with consumers, producers, distributors, and retail wine shops, writing and refining interview guides for each role I interviewed.</p>
    <p>After two weeks of interviews, I collated all my notes into a master document and extracted the key insights to clarify my understanding of the wine industry and its problems.</p>

        <h6>The Wine Supply Chain</h6>
        <p>Producer > Distributor > Retailer > Consumer. Each have their own needs, tools, and barriers.</p>

        <h4>Key Insight</h4>
        <hr class="line">
        <h6>How We Buy Wine</h6>
        <p>Price. Label design. Social proof. Wine is a commodity masquerading (and sold) as a luxury good. Good wine experiences account for both the commodified portion and the emotional portion.</p>

        <h4>Key Insight</h4>
        <hr class="line">
        <h6>User Themes</h6>
        <p>Some consumers are solidly in the wine camp and know what they want. The rest are along a spectrum and buy wine with their own mindsets and contexts.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="container full">
    <h3>Define & Focus</h3>
    <p>Interviews uncovered problems and opportunities throughout the wine supply chain. I chose to focus on the consumer experience because current consumer technology offerings are extremely limited or poorly executed (with some exceptions‚ÄìCellarTracker.com).</p>
    <p>Further focusing, I discarded wine consumers who are likely to know exactly what they want most of the time and consumers who know too little (don‚Äôt care about wine apps) or too much (already know what they want).</p>
    <h3>Personas and Empathy Maps</h3>
    <p>From my interview themes, I synthesized three personas: Everyday Al, Self-Conscious Sal, and Tyler The Enthused. I combined my empathy maps and personas in a hybrid document that described key behavioral components.</p>
    <h3>Experience Maps</h3>
    <p>Using these personas as swimlanes, I mapped the consumer wine experience from pre-purchase to post-consumption. The experience mapping process exposed gaps in my understanding of the existing consumer journey and identified UX improvement opportunities.</p>
    <p>After my first pass, I used the question marks on my map, of which there were many, to craft new interview guides and ask better questions of interviewees.</p>
    <p>Each persona has unique goals, obstacles, and anxieties through each phase of the experience, all taken from interviews with consumers. The map view clearly shows problems and opportunities with the consumer wine experience</p>

        <h6>Motivation</h6>
        <p>Users are establishing need and making a plan. Ask: ‚Äúwhy is this person hiring wine and why?‚Äù</p>

    <h3>Hypotheses & Most Dangerous Assumptions</h3>
    <p>From the opportunities in my experience map, I outlined four solutions: a locally-available wine list, a wine education tool, a stronger retail environment utilizing virtual reality, and marketing tools for wine producers.</p>
    <p>As the wine list and the retail environments solved for more critical user anxieties and obstacles problems, so I focused on those. To further clarify, I outlined my most dangerous assumptions, user groups,  and what each prototype would and would not be explicitly testing for.</p>
    <p>The prototyping process is a series of small experiments in which the designer uses artifacts to elicit new information about users‚Äô as well as test key elements of their proposed solution. Both of my prototypes were designed to do both of those things, and ultimately succeeded by eliciting new insights about the industry and user experience, as well as validating and invalidating core value propositions.</p>
    <h3>Prototyping & Test-Driven Design</h3>
    <p>The prototyping process is a series of small experiments in which the designer uses artifacts to elicit new information about users‚Äô as well as test key elements of their proposed solution. Both of my prototypes were designed to do both of those things, and ultimately succeeded by eliciting new insights about the industry and user experience, as well as validating and invalidating core value propositions.</p>
    <h3>Prototype #1: ‚ÄúCellar App‚Äù</h3>
    <h6>Hypothesis</h6>
    <p>Availability in proximity is the biggest factor in a wine purchase. Providing users a filterable stream of locally-available wines with relevant details solves for anxieties in the motivation and acquisition stages, creating a wine purchase.</p>
    <h6>Most Dangerous Assumptions</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Wine buying is sufficiently painful for target users to hire help in the form of an app</li>
      <li>Users are open to shopping at proximate stores</li>
      <li>The tech can recommend wine better than the individual‚Äôs base intuition</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>User Groups</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Tech-savvy wine consumers who know some things about their wine tastes but not enough to be carefree in their wine selection.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="cl-2">
        <h6>Testing For</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Use-case viability</li>
          <li>Core USP: locally-available wine recommendations</li>
          <li>What wine profile information is relevant</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="cl-2">
        <h6>Not Testing For</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Interface and information accuracy</li>
          <li>Personal list functionality</li>
          <li>Education</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h6>Valid If</h6>
    <p>Users find a wine they are comfortable buying when provided personal criteria.</p>
    <h3>The Flow</h3>
    <p>A mobile application that presents the user with a filtered stream of locally-available (within an adjustable radius) wines paired with their CellarTracker.com rating and flavor abstracts.</p>
    <p>I built a POP prototype for initial flow testing as well as a Sketch + InVision prototype to solve for fidelity issues. The InVision prototype:</p>
    <div class="tc">
      <iframe width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/NA9NSTLSR" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
    <h3>Test Results: üö´</h3>
    <p>I tested the app with wine consumers who weren‚Äôt part of my initial interviews. Although the value proposition of location-based availability for the wines resonated, the presented information (CellarTracker rating and flavor abstracts) didn‚Äôt resonate more than the alternative of walking into a store and reading labels.</p>
    <p>Additionally, users weren‚Äôt so anxious about their wine picks that they would think to download an app to present better wine picks. Although a mobile app might solve for anxieties and produce desired outcomes, user acquisition would most likely be prohibitively expensive.</p>
    <h3>Prototype #2: Virtual Reality</h3>
    <p>Virtual reality is cool but hasn‚Äôt been used for much aside from storytelling and painting and also Harmonix is putting Rockband in VR. However, there‚Äôs a flipside to VR that really no one has touched: building a better physical reality using VR as space and systems prototyping. Imperatively: test your expensive physical systems in VR and then build them in reality.</p>
    <h6>Hypothesis</h6>
    <p>We can use virtual reality to quickly test unique wine displays and retail store layouts that give consumers appropriate and compelling information leading to better in-store conversion rates.</p>
    <h6>Most Dangerous Assumptions</h6>
    <ul>
      <li>Liquor stores are interested in making more wine sales</li>
      <li>Wine producer networks will take marketing risks</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>User Groups</h6>
    <li>Tech-savvy wine consumers who know some things about their wine tastes but not enough to be carefree in their wine selection.</li>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="cl-2">
        <h6>Testing For</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Can VR help us understand consumer behavior?</li>
          <li>Can VR allow us to effectively prototype physical spaces?</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="cl-2">
        <h6>Not Testing For</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>Fidelity</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>


    <h6>Valid If</h6>
    <li>Users react more positively to the new layouts in VR than the existing layouts recreated in VR.</li>
