    <h4>Bite-sized UX & UI</h4>
    <h2>Enter Onboarding üèÑüèΩ</h2>
    <h3>Enter App</h3>
    <p>Enter is an iPad app that acts as a digital doorbell for office guests, pinging the appropriate contact through relevant communication channels when a guest or package arrives. The app was built internally for Fresh Tilled Soil and then spun into a stand-alone product.</p>

    <h3>The Engagement</h3>
    <p>During my time at Fresh, Dan, the lead for Enter, approached me about working with the team to re-design the onboarding flow. I spent two days on the project over the course of two weeks, communicating and reviewing work with the team until I moved the final UI prototype from Sketch to Invision for testing and implementation.</p>
    <p> This project showcases a standard application of accepted design patterns with a few small tweaks for novel functionality.</p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>Good onboarding experiences expertly guide people through the anxiety and confusion of a new product until they reach value. The time-to-value needs to be as short as possible and control for distractions and key anxieties that would otherwise turn a user away.</p>
    <p>In Enter's case, there is a large amount of data that needs to be entered to get the product up-and-running, initially by the office manager, and then on an asynchronous basis by everyone else in the office.</p>
    <p>Additionally, because the app runs on an iPad, the onboarding is potentially split between multiple devices, which adds another level of confusion and two potential tripping points to the flow.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>By using the office manager's information collected during the free trial setup as the first user profile, the product is functional very early on in the onboarding flow. Potentially within 2-3 minutes of clicking the free-trial signup button. The rest of the information can then be added a variety of ways to maximize value to the user and help them welcome guests.</p>
