    <h4>Techstars rates</h4>
    <p>I work with TS companies at significantly reduced daily rates (~50%), remote or onsite. Currently I'm based in Boston but make trips to Boulder and  Berlin.</p>
    <h4>How I can help</h4>
    <p>Early brand materials, pitch decks (+ animation), product design, UX and interaction design, user research, and user testing. Familiar with information architecture design, content strategy (not the marketing kind), and microcopy. Front-end development if it's doomsday.</p>
