      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>A wineryâ€™s biggest asset is the experience of visiting the vineyards and
      tasting room. But worsening regulatory environments in wine regions across the U.S. limit the size and throughput of tasting rooms while restricting vineyard events, making it
      <strong>impossible to scale the first-hand winery experience that distinguishes
      a wine to consumers and buyers.</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class="level">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>We recreate the vineyard and winery experience in virtual reality where buyers and consumers are immersed in a wineryâ€™s history, rich atmosphere, and take part in daily operations.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s a taste of the winery experience.</p>

      <h2>Process</h2>
      <h3>Phase 1: Discovery</h3>
      <p>My research began with interviews with distributors, a wine shop owner, and liquor store employees to set context and build domain knowledge.</p>

    <div class="solo full">
      <h3>Phase 2: Define</h3>
      <p>Later I interviewed brewery owners and conducted contextual inquiry with consumers, notetaking as people talked me through their wine purchasing process in retail and service environments.</p>
      <p>This led me to an initial problem statement that I used to form a couple hypotheses and corresponding prototypes.</p>
      <h4>A Behavior Model</h4>
      <p>Using research insights, I outlined a surface-level wine purchase behavior model to clarify and communicate my understanding of the people involved and how they made purchase decisions. <a href="../img/studies/wineux/behavior.pdf">You can read it here (44kb).</a></p>
      <h4 id="docs">Personas and Experience Maps</h4>
      <p>From my interview themes, I synthesized three personas, built out empathy maps, and used those personas as swimlanes in an experience map for the wine purchasing process. For brevity, I have excluded these deliverables with the exception of the experience map, below.</p>

    <div class="solo full">
      <h3>Phase 3: Diverge (Initial Prototypes and Testing)</h3>
      <p>From the opportunities in my experience map and the product-market gaps, I outlined four solutions: a locally-available wine list, a wine education tool, a stronger retail environment utilizing virtual reality, and marketing tools for wine producers.</p>
      <p>Initially I built a mobile prototype that provided a locally-available wine list, but after a few user tests, it was clear that the app wasn't getting to the heart of the problem or leveraging the unique aspects of the wine industry.</p>

      <h2>To VR</h2>
      <h3>Why Virtual Reality</h3>
      <p>One of the best ways to fall in love with a wine is to walk through the vineyards and wineries from which it is produced while soaking up the sights, sounds, and smells associated with the process of creating the wine. </p>
      <p>Although there are no smells or tactile sensations involved in virtual reality (yet), my guess was that being immersed in a virtual vineyard could be an engaging and educational experience.</p>
      <p>If you're interested in the nitty-gritty of Unity development and VR user testing, there is a writeup <a href="/work/winevr" target="new"> that covers my dev process in-depth here.</a></p>

      <h3>User Testing</h3>
      <p>Although most of my testing was focused on navigability and story,  walking through the prototype generated a huge amount of enthusiastic discussion from testers about wine, favorite vineyards, past experiences, and preferences.</p>
      <p>I circled back with industry contacts whom I interviewed during the initial research phase and used them as nodes through whom to reach further into the wine industry for customer development interviews. Some of these people became invaluable advisors.</p>

      <h3>Customer Development &amp; Partnership Work</h3>
      <p>The wine industry is just beginning to get the hang of email marketing, and is a long way from adopting VR as a marketing strategy. Most wine marketers and salespeople don't have the language to conceptualize the impact of VR experiences. Despite this, partnership conversations are ongoing with forward-thinking distributors and wine region associations.</p>
